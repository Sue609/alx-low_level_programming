In today's project we shall look at malloc.
Malloc is a dynamic memory allocation that allocates memory during runtime. malloc basically means memory allocation, the benefits of using malloc is that there is no wastage of memory unlike static memory allocation. 
The syntax of malloc is void* malloc(size_t size);

The malloc function takes as input the number of bytes to be allocated and returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory block. The allocated memory block can be used to store any type of data.
