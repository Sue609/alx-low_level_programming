In this project we shall be dealing with pointers and arrays.
Pointers contain the adress of a variable, we first need to declare a variable then we go agead and declare the pointer then lastly we initialize the pointer.
In arrays they are collections of more than one date items of the same type. All the data items are stored in contagious memory allocation. The indexes start from 0.
