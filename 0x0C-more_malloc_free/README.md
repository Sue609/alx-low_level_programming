MALLOC
This is a function that allocates memory to a block of array. it returns a pointer which inturn shows the address of the specific variable. After using malloc we should free the memory to avoid segmentation fault. Malloc uses dynamic memory allocation and therefore it is flexible and does not allow wastage of memory.
