SINGLE_LINKED LIST
This is a type af date structure whre data is represented in nodes which contain the date and the link which is usually a pointer. The linked list data is not represented in a sequential order but it is represented in random points in the memory that is why we have to link each node to the last using pointers.

The head which represents the address of the first node is a pointer. The last node is usually pointing to the NULL which indicates the end of the linked list. We can easily add and delete nodes in the linked list which is a big limitation when using arrays.
