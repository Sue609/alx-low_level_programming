BITWISE OPERATORS

* `AND(&): Takes two numbers and performs bitwise and. Result of and is 1 when both bits are 1.`
* `OR(|): Takes two numbers and performs or. Result of or is 0 when both bits are 0 and 1 when one of the bits or both of the bits are 1.`
* `left shift operator(>>): it is a unary operand.
 when bits are shifted left then trailing positions are filled with zeros.`
* `Right shift operator(<<): When bits are shifted right the leading positions are filled with zeros.`
* `Bitwise XOR:
   We have inclusive and exclusive OR.`
