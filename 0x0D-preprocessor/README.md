MACROS & PREPROCESSOR
A macro is a sequence of instructions that is defined once and then used multiple times throughout the program. Macros are usually used to perform repetitive tasks, such as setting default values or performing complex calculations.

The preprocessor is a program that is run before the actual compilation of code. It processes the source code and performs various tasks such as text replacement, file inclusion, and conditional compilation. The preprocessor uses a set of predefined commands called directives to perform these tasks. Some common directives include #define, #include, and #ifdef.
The preprocessor is often used in conjunction with macros to simplify code and make it more readable.
