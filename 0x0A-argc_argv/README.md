argc stands for "argument count" and is an integer representing the number of command-line arguments passed to the program when it is executed. The value of argc is always at least 1, because the first argument is always the name of the program itself. Additional arguments can be passed to the program by separating them with spaces when executing the program.
argv stands for "argument vector" and is a pointer to an array of character pointers. Each element of the array (argv[0], argv[1], etc.) points to a string that represents one of the command-line arguments passed to the program. The first element of argv (argv[0]) is always a pointer to a string that contains the name of the program itself.
