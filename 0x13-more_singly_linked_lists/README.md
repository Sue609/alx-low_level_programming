Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. They include a series of connected nodes.
Advantages of Linked Lists over arrays:
Dynamic Array.
Ease of Insertion/Deletion.
Insertion at the beginning is a constant time operation and takes O(1) time, as compared to arrays where inserting an element at the beginning takes O(n) time,where n is the number of elements in the array.
