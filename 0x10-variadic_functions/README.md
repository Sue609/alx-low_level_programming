VARIADIC FUNCTIONS

This function is found in the stdarg.h which is the starndard arguement function. This function allows the user to pass very many arguements without specifying them and are declared with an ellipsis in place of the last parameter.

We have the function 'va_list' which allows the user to access the variable list. 
We have other macros found in this library: va_start, va_end, va_arg and va_copy.
